# Feature Class Prediction using Machine Learning

## Problem statement: 

> To predict feature class from the feature class element and feature class geometry type.

## Data description:

> 1. All features are catagorical.

> 2. To implement ML algorithm we need to convert the catgorical data to numerical values.

> 3. Choosing one hot encoding which will best suite to this sample data.

## Apply ML algorithm

> 1. Choosing Random Forest ML algorithm.

> 2. A test data was drawn form the primary data for model testing.

> 3. Trainig data includes complete data.
